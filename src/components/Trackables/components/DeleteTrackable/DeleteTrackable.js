// Use AntDrawer like in AddTrackable component
// Also button below Add trackable button (delete trackable)
// See there a list of all trackables
// Probably possible to use getTrackables (from fetch file)
// Possibility to delete some with button
// For deleting: find trackable id and write DELETE req
// Delete trackable_id from every day entry (loop over every day entry in entries table) in db
// Delete whole trackable entry in trackables in db
